title: Terraform Workshop Environment
teaser: An instruqt track template that you can copy and use for in your own demos
  and workshops.
description: |-
  This track can be copied and used as a starting point for Azure, GCP or AWS Terraform workshops. You can use it as-is for freestyle training, or customize it for specific use cases.

  It comes with AWS, GCP and Azure credentials pre-installed and ready to use with Terraform. To use this track, simply copy the entire terraform-workshop-base directory and strip out all of the `id:` lines from your track.yml. Rename the tracks, create some content, run an `instruqt track push` and off you go.

  teaser: Configure your code editor with the HCL extension and open a workspace.
  assignment: |-
    Open the Code Editor tab on the left. First get familiar with the menus.

    Find the "hamburger" or triple-line menu on the top of the navigation bar on the left. It's right underneath the Instruqt mascot logo. This is your Main Menu. You can find all the other VSC menu options here.

    Right below the Main Menu you'll see a column of icons. The first icon looks like a stack of documents. This is the File Explorer.

    Next you can enable the Terraform Language Server for syntax highlighting and other features. Click on the Main Menu and select **View >> Command Palette**, then type in `Terraform`.

    Select the option that says **Terraform: Enable/Disable Language Server**. You only need to click this once. It will activate in the background and generate a couple of notifications.

    Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform. We'll use the hashicat example app in the rest of the challenges as you learn new terraform skills.

    Click the **Check** button to continue.

  teaser: Terraform commands are run from a terminal window. Terraform can be installed
    on Linux, Windows, or MacOS.
  assignment: |-
    Click on the Main Menu and select **Terminal > New Terminal** or use the keyboard shortcut **CTRL-J** (**CMD-J** on Mac).

    All terraform commands should be run from the terminal within the Code Editor.

    Try the **CTRL-J** shortcut to toggle the terminal window open and closed.

    You can use the little caret ^ shaped button on the terminal pane to expand and shrink your Terminal window. This is useful for viewing logs.

    Click on the File Explorer icon a couple times to toggle the File Explorer on and off. This can provide more space while you're viewing and editing code.

    You can also hide and show these notes with the expand icon on the upper right side of the GUI. It looks like a box with two small arrows in the corners. This will expand and close the notes panel. Try it now to give your text editor more space.
