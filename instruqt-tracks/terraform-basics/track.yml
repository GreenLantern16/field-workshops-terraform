    Let's get started with Terraform on Azure. First we need some credentials. Run the script below to fetch dynamic Azure credentials from HashiCorp Vault.

    ```
    setup_azure.sh
    ```

    If the command ran successfully you should get a message that says `Setup script complete.`

    Run the following command to load your creds into the current shell. This will happen automatically for all the rest of the challenges.

    ```
    source .bashrc
    ```

    Congratulations! You have Azure credentials that you can use to start building with Terraform.
