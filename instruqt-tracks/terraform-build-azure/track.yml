  teaser: Configure your code editor with the HCL extension and open a workspace.
  assignment: |-
    Open the Code Editor tab on the left.

    Select "File > Open Folder".

    Open the `hashicat-azure` directory in the Code Editor.

    This is your terraform workspace.

    Now click on the box-shaped icon on the left side menu. This opens the Extensions sidebar.

    Search for *hcl*. Install the first extension on the list. It is named `HCL`.

    Click on the blue **Reload Required** button to refresh the editor.

    Now click on the explorer icon on the left side menu. It looks like a stack of documents.

    Congratulations, you've configured your environment to work with Terraform!

  assignment: |-
    Open the main.tf file in the Code Editor.

    You'll notice that most of the file is commented out with `#` symbols. At the top of the file there's a single terraform resource which builds an Azure Resource group.

    You can easily provision your applications in different geographical regions by
    simply changing a single variable.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge we'll set the *prefix* and *location* variables. The prefix will become part of your application's URL, and the location determines which Azure datacenter our app will be deployed into.

    Choose the Azure location nearest to you.

    Examples:<br/>
    centralus     - Iowa<br/>
    eastus        - Virginia<br/>
    westus        - California<br/>
    uksouth       - London<br/>
    southindia    - Chennai<br/>
    eastasia      - Hong Kong<br/>
    canadacentral - Toronto<br/>

    Edit the *terraform.tfvars* file to set your *location* and *prefix* variables.

    Keep your prefix string all lower case, and between 5-12 characters long.

    Save the terraform.tfvars file.

    that terraform might make. When you run terraform apply these changes are implemented,
    and terraform builds, updates, or destroys resources.
  assignment: |-
    Now that we've configured our required variables we can apply our changes.

    Run the *terraform plan* command first to see what will happen:

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

    Then run *terraform apply* and watch your resource group being built.

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    You'll need to enter *yes* when terraform prompts you with the "Do you want to perform these actions?" question.

    Right now our code only defines a single Azure resource group. We'll be building upon this starting point in the next challenge.

  assignment: |-
    Try running **terraform plan** again and see what happens:

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

    Since your Azure resource group has already been built, terraform will report that there are no changes required.

    This is normal and expected.

    Now try running another apply:

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    Terraform checks each resource to ensure it is in the proper state. It will not re-create your resource group if it is already provisioned correctly.

    Save the **terraform.tfvars** file and run your apply command again.

    You can use the `-auto-approve` flag to avoid having to type "yes" every time you apply.

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Observe the output. What happened?
  notes:

      Terraform can create, destroy, update in place, or destroy and re-create your infrastructure. Some types of resources can be updated without deleting them. Major changes usually require a teardown and rebuild.

      Terraform always tries to match the current infrastructure to what has been defined in your code.

    Add a tag to your resource group in the *main.tf* file.

    Save the file and re-run `terraform apply`.

    What happens?

  assignment: |-
    Open the *main.tf* file again and uncomment the next resource block in the file. The type of resource is **azurerm_virtual_network** and it is named **vnet**.

    Uncomment the code by removing the `#` characters from the beginning of each line.

    Save the file.

    Now run `terraform apply` again. Observe the results.

    Look at the **location** and **resource_group_name** parameters inside the vnet resource. See how they point back at the first resource in the file? The virtual network resource inherits settings from the resource group.

    Terraform can map out the complex web of dependencies between hundreds of interconnected resources.

    terraform plan

    Now run an apply to build the HashiCat application:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    It can take up to five minutes for the application to finish deploying. You will know it is complete when you see the Terraform output with your application URL at the end of the run.

  assignment: |-
    There are several ways to configure Terraform variables. So far we've been using the **terraform.tfvars** file to set our variables. Try re-deploying your application with different **height** and **width** variables on the command line. Reload the webapp after each apply to observe any changes.

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var height=600 -var width=800
    ```

    Next try setting an environment variable that Terraform can read. Run this command to set the placeholder variable:

    ```
    export TF_VAR_placeholder=placedog.net
    ```

    Run another *terraform apply* command:
    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Now try it again with the same variable set differently on the command line:
    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var placeholder=placebear.com

    Edit the `remote_backend.tf` file. Replace the organization with your sandbox organization name. Replace the workspace name with **hashicat**. Save the file.

    Now run a *terraform init* to migrate your state to Terraform Cloud:

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    Type "yes" when it prompts you to migrate your state into Terraform Cloud.

    Your state is now safely stored in Terraform Cloud.
