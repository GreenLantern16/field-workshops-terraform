  teaser: Learn terraform basics and command line syntax.
  assignment: |-
    Let's start with some basic terraform commands.

    Run the following commands in the terminal on the left.

    Check the version of Terraform running on your machine:
    ```
    terraform version
    ```

    You can always get help if you're curious about command syntax:
    ```
    terraform help
    ```

    Terraform runs on Windows, OSX, or Linux. You can install it on your laptop or on a cloud based workstation. Terraform is also pre-installed in Azure Cloud Shell.

    Today we'll be using the preconfigured terraform workstation on the left for all our lab exercises.

  title: "\U0001F510 Connecting Terraform to Azure Cloud"
  teaser: Safely connect to the Azure APIs using a service principal.
  assignment: |-
    Terraform needs credentials to be able to connect to Azure and build resources.

    We've pre-installed some temporary credentials in your Instruqt training environment. These credentials are stored as environment variables. You should never store sensitive API keys inside your source code.

    Terraform can automatically read and use the environment variables that are in your shell environment.

    Run the following command to see your temporary credentials:

    ```
    env | grep ARM_CLIENT
    ```

    *Do not ever store your credentials in source code files*, as they can be accidentally exposed or copied to a public repository.

  teaser: The terraform DSL (Domain Specific Language) is a declarative language that
    lets you build almost any type of infrastructure.
  assignment: |-
    We've downloaded some terraform code onto your workstation. Run the following command to see the terraform code files:

    ```
    ls *.tf
    ```

    The same files are visible in the file explorer pane on the left. Terraform files are marked with the purple T icon.

    Terraform code always ends with a `.tf` extension. You can have as many terraform files as you want, but these three are commonly created first:

    **main.tf** - Where most of your terraform code is stored. This is the part that does the building of resources.

    **variables.tf** - Use this file to define which variables will be available to your users.

    **outputs.tf** - This file contains outputs that will be shown at the end of a successful terraform run.

    Files that end in anything other than `*.tf` or `*.tfvars` are ignored by Terraform.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform will read anything in the current directory that ends in `*.tf` or `*.tfvars`.

      By convention most terraform workspaces will contain `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files.

      You can also group your terraform code into files by purpose. For example, you might place all your load balancer configuration code into a file called `load_balancer.tf`.

  title: ☁️ Terraform Init - Install the Azure Provider
  teaser: Terraform needs a provider to talk to cloud APIs. The provider is the bridge
    that connects terraform core to your infrastructure providers.
  assignment: |-
    We have downloaded some terraform code for the HashiCat application. We'll be using this source code for the rest of the track.

    Before we can do anything with terraform we need to initialize our workspace. Run the following    command in your terminal window:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    The *terraform init* command scans your terraform code, identifies any providers that are needed,    and downloads them.

    Run the following command to take a peek inside the `.terraform` directory:

    ```
    ls .terraform/plugins/linux_amd64/
    ```

    This hidden directory is where all modules and plugins are stored.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The terraform core program isn't very useful by itself. Terraform needs the help of a *provider* to be able to talk to cloud APIs. Terraform has hundreds of different providers. You can browse the provider list here:

      https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html

      Today we'll be using the *azurerm* provider. AzureRM stands for Azure Resource Manager.

  title: "\U0001F469‍⚖️ Terraform Validate - Test Your Code"
  teaser: Terraform has a built in validation tester. This is useful to see whether
    your Terraform code is valid and parses correctly.
  assignment: |-
    Terraform comes with a built-in subcommand called *validate*. This is useful when you want to do a quick syntax check of your code to make sure it parses correctly.

    Click on the File Explorer icon on the left. It looks like a stack of papers.

    Edit the main.tf file and remove the curly brace on line 4 of the file.

    Validate your code:

    ```
    terraform validate
    ```

    Now put the curly brace back onto line 4 and run the validate command again. This time you should pass the validation test.

    **terraform validate** is most often used in automated CI/CD test pipelines. It allows you to quickly catch errors in your code before any other steps are taken.

  title: "\U0001F914 Terraform Plan - Dry Run Mode"
  teaser: Terraform has a dry run mode where you can preview what will be built without
    actually creating any resources. In this challenge we'll run terraform plan and
    view the output.
  assignment: |-
    Run the **terraform plan** command:

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

    When you run this command terraform will prompt you to enter the `prefix` variable.

    Enter a short string of lower-case letters and/or numbers. You can use your own name here if you wish.

    **Keep your prefix string all lower case, and between 5-12 characters long. Do not use an underscore in your prefix.**

    The prefix will become part of your application hostname, and therefore must be DNS-compliant. Valid characters for hostnames are ASCII(7) letters from a to z, the digits from 0 to 9, and the hyphen (-).  A hostname may not start with a hyphen.

      `terraform plan` allows you to preview any changes to your environment in a safe way.

      This can help you identify any unexpected changes before you deploy them, not after they are already built.

  title: "\U0001F39B️ Working with Terraform Variables"
  teaser: Terraform variables allow you to customize your infrastructure without editing
    any code. You can use the same terraform code to deploy dev, staging and production
    but with different variables.
  assignment: |-
    We've created a **terraform.tfvars** file for you to edit. This is a special file where you can set any variables you wish to change from their defaults.

    Variables are *defined* in the **variables.tf** file. They are *set* in the **terraform.tfvars** file.

    In terraform all variables must be declared (with or without an optional default value) before you can use them.

    Open the **terraform.tfvars** file and set your prefix variable there. Save the file.

    Now run `terraform plan` again. This time you won't have to enter your prefix manually.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: The **terraform.tfvars** file is a convenient place for users to configure

  title: "\U0001F5FC Change Your Location"
  teaser: Terraform is flexible enough to deploy infrastructure anywhere in the world.
    You can easily provision your applications in different geographical regions by
    simply changing a single variable.
  assignment: |-
    In one of the previous challenges we set our *prefix* variable.

    Choose the Azure location nearest to you and set the location variable in your **terraform.tfvars** file. You may need to close and re-open the file if it appears blank.

    You can find a list of valid Azure locations here:

    https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/locations/

    Examples:

    centralus - Iowa<br>
    eastus    - Virginia<br>
    westus     - California<br>
    uksouth    - London<br>
    southindia - Chennai<br>
    eastasia   - Hong Kong<br>
    canadacentral - Toronto

    Once you've set your location variable try running `terraform plan` again. What's different this time?

    HINT: Remember that you can set any variable you wish in the **terraform.tfvars** file.

  title: "\U0001F4CA Terraform Graph - Seeing is Believing"
  teaser: Terraform creates a graph of all the infrastructure defined in your code.
    Let's visualize the graph and see what your infrastructure map looks like.
  assignment: |-
    The **terraform graph** command can generate a DOT-formatted graph of your infrastructure. DOT is a graph description language. DOT files can be used with visualization tools like Graphviz.

    Run the terraform graph command now to see the raw output:

    ```
    terraform graph
    ```

    Now let's plot this raw data using the free Blast Radius visualizer. We've pre-installed blast-radius for you. Run the following command then open the **Terraform Graph** tab to see the results:

    ```
    blast-radius --serve .
    ```

    Once Blast Radius is up and running, click on the **Terraform Graph** tab to view the interactive graph.

    You can use your mouse to click and drag the graph around. Even though we only have one single resource group, all of the variables in our config files are included in the graph. In the next track you'll build more complex infrastructure and watch your graph grow.
