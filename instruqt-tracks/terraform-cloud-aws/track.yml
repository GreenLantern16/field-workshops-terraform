  title: "\U0001F3E1 Moving in - Set Up Your Workspace"
  teaser: Configure your code editor with the HCL extension and open a workspace.
  assignment: |-
    Welcome to your first day as an intern at ACME Inc. [ACME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m7evoFF83c) is a multi-national conglomerate that sells anvils, rocket powered roller skates, deyhdrated boulders, earthquake pills and birdseed.

    After employee orientation you sit down at your workstation and open your text editor, Visual Studio Code.

    Open the Code Editor tab on the left.

    Select "File > Open Folder".

    Find the `hashicat-aws` directory in the Code Editor and hit `OK`.

    This is your terraform workspace.

    Now click on the box-shaped icon on the bottom of the left side menu. This opens the Extensions sidebar.

    Search for *hcl*. Install the first extension on the list. It is named `HCL`.

    Click on the blue **Reload Required** button to refresh the editor.

    Now click on the explorer icon on the top of the left side menu. It looks like a stack of documents.

    Congratulations, you've configured your environment to work with Terraform!

  title: "\U0001F5A5️ Open a Terminal"
  teaser: Terraform commands are run from a terminal window. Terraform can be installed
    on Linux, Windows, or MacOS.
  assignment: |-
    Open a new Terminal window. You can use the "Terminal > New Terminal" menu item or the keyboard shortcut **CTRL-J** (**CMD-J** on Mac).

    All terraform commands should be run from the terminal within the Code Editor.

    Try the **CTRL-J** shortcut to toggle the terminal window open and closed.

    You can use the little caret ^ shaped button on the terminal pane to expand and shrink your Terminal window. This is useful for viewing logs.

    Click on the File Explorer icon a couple times to toggle the File Explorer on and off. This can provide more space while you're viewing and editing code.

    You can also hide and show these notes with the expand icon on the upper right side of the GUI. It looks like a box with two small arrows in the corners. This will expand and close the notes panel. Try it now to give your text editor more space.
