# Infrastructure as Code

* Terraform code is written in HCL
* Stop building things by hand
* Put everything into repeatable Terraform configuration
* All build steps are now expressed as code
* If you ever have to rebuild something, it's much easier!

# Terraform Cloud
![](images/tfc-gui.png)

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that provides the following features:

???
**Until now we've been using only open source features. Sooner or later you'll reach a point where you want more tools for governance and collaboration. Terraform open source is great for small environments and developers, but when you need multiple people or teams to collaborate on the same infrastructure, Terraform Cloud features can help.**

---

class: img-right
# Terraform Cloud
![](images/tfc-gui.png)

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that provides the following features:

* UI integration with VCS

???
**As your organization begins to standardize on Terraform, you'll have different types of users. Most of you will become terraform experts, but there may be others who just want to build things. They can use the terraform code that folks like you have written. To make this process easy, we have a web application. You log on, click a button, and out pops your infrastructure.**

---
name: why-tfc-3
class: img-right
# Terraform Cloud
![](images/tfc-gui.png)

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that provides the following features:

* UI integration with VCS
* API driven workflows

???
**For our more advanced users we have a fully featured RESTful API. This is useful for programmatic access to terraform features. You can drive terraform plan and apply commands using an API interface. If you have a CI/CD pipeline you can automate your terraform builds as part of your process.**

---

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that provides the following features:

* UI integration with VCS
* API driven workflows
* Central state management

???
**Terraform enterprise also provides safe and secure storage for your state files. Instead of having that important state file stored on someone's laptop, now it is safely stored in the Terraform Cloud application. Only those who need access to the state file can see it, and it is protected from being overwritten or corrupted.**

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that provides the following features:

* UI integration with VCS
* API driven workflows
* Central state management
* Private Module Registry

???
**Eventually you'll have a library of Terraform code that you might like to share and publish for other users and teams in your company. The private module registry makes this easy. You build reusable modules that build infrastructure according to standards, and then publish them for your users. This can help with enforcing security policies and build standards.**

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that provides the following features:

* UI integration with VCS
* API driven workflows
* Central state management
* Private Module Registry
* Sentinel policy enforcement

???
**TFE also comes with a policy enforcement engine that can ensure that your users don't build things they shouldn't build, or configure them in the wrong way. For example, you might wish to prevent users from opening network ports to the internet, or from building too many virtual machines. All of these types of rules can be expressed using our Sentinel policy enforcement engine. Sentinel policies prevent users from doing bad things, *before* they provision to the cloud.**

**Terraform enterprise can store and encrypt your cloud credentials, passwords or any other sensitive data. These credentials are stored safely inside of a Vault instance that runs inside of TFE.**

---
name: terraform-cloud-enterprise
# Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise?
**[Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/signup)** is a hosted application that provides features like remote state management, API driven runs, policy management and more. Many users prefer a cloud based SaaS solution because they don't want to maintain the infrastructure to run it.

**[Terraform Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/go/terraform-enterprise)** is the same application, but it runs in your cloud environment or data center. Some users require more control over the Terraform Cloud application, or wish to run it in restricted networks behind corporate firewalls.

The feature list for these two offerings is nearly identical. We will be using Terraform Cloud accounts for our lab exercises today.

# Terraform Command Review

Let's review some of the most useful terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init    # Initialize the current directory
terraform plan    # Dry run to see what Terraform will do
terraform apply   # Apply the Terraform code and build stuff
terraform destroy # Destroy what was built by Terraform
terraform refresh # Refresh the state file
terraform output  # View Terraform outputs
terraform graph   # Create a DOT-formatted graph
```

Need a refresher? Try the [Intro to Terraform on AWS](https://instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/terraform-build-aws) lab exercises.

???
Depending on the maturity of your audience you might take a detour back to the Intro to Terraform track. Ideally everyone in the workshop has already completed this or has equivalent experience with Terraform OSS.

# Terraform State
```tex
  "primary": {
      "id": "i-0413fe5b4509d65b1",

          "ami": "ami-06f2f779464715dc5",
```

Terraform stores information about the resources it has built in a **state file**. This important file contains all of the data that Terraform needs to change, update, and delete infrastructure.

By default, the state file is stored in your local workspace.

---
name: why-not-local-state
class: img-left-full
# Oops, I Lost My State File

![](images/dog_homework.jpg)

The local state file has some disadvantages:

* Sometimes contains secrets or sensitive data
* Can't collaborate because the file is on someone's laptop
* Risk of losing or deleting the state file
* No centralized record keeping

---
name: tfcloud-remote-state
# Terraform Cloud Remote State
Terraform Cloud Remote State is free and available to all users. The requirements to get it set up and working are below.

* Free or paid Terraform Cloud account
* A **`.terraformrc`** (Unix/Linux) or **`terraform.rc`** (Windows) config file
* User access token stored in your config file
* Remote backend config file. We name it **`remote_backend.tf`** for consistency.

**WARNING** - do not copy your Terraform Cloud API token to github!

https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/remote.html

???
Please raise your right hand and repeat after me:

"I will never store credentials in my terraform workspace."

>"I think efforts like GitHub‚Äôs Token Scanning project should be applauded, but they are only effective once a leak has already occurred. This problem also is likely not isolated to GitHub ‚Äì it will affect any publicly available code. We need more research to develop systems that help developers avoid this mistake in the first place."

# Protecting Sensitive Variables
![](images/encryption.jpg)

* Cloud API Keys
* Passwords
* SSH private keys
* SSL certificates
* Any sensitive text or data

---
name: where-are-your-creds
# Where Are Your API Keys?
Terraform requires credentials in order to communicate with your cloud provider's API.

These API keys should **never** be stored directly in your terraform code.

Config files and environment variables are a better option, but the credentials still live on your workstation, usually stored in plaintext.

---
name: a-better-way-creds
# A Better Way to Store Sensitive Data

Terraform Cloud can safely store your credentials and encrypt them for you. You can use this encrypted storage for passwords, TLS Certificates, SSH keys or anything else that should not be lying around in plain text.

# Teams for Terraform Collaboration
![](images/teams_gui.png)

Teams are used to grant different levels of access to different parts of your Terraform infrastructure, depending on the user's role.

Workspaces access levels include read, plan, write, and admin. Super users can also be granted organization wide permissions for managing policies and VCS settings.

# What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

![:scale 70%](images/distributed_vcs.png)

Version control systems are applications that allow users to store, track, test, and collaborate on changes to their infrastructure and applications.

Terraform Cloud integrates with most common Version Control Systems.

---
name: tfc-infra-as-code-workflow
class: img-left
# VCS Integration with Terraform Cloud

![:scale 70%](images/git_noobs.png)

Terraform Cloud can directly integrate with source code repos in GitHub Enteprise, Gitlab, and Bitbucket. This allows you to build simple DevOps workflows with code reviews, testing and approvals.

https://xkcd.com/1597/

For this workshop you'll only need four or five git commands.

---
name: multi-user-collaboration
class: img-right-full
# User Collaboration
![](images/commitstrip_devops.jpg)
Users from different teams or departments can all benefit from centralized infrastructure as code.

Infrastructure changes are no longer created in isolated silos.

Each team can contribute or consume Terraform code according to their needs.

---
name: vcs-driven-workflow
# Automated Test Pipelines
.center[![:scale 60%](images/git_workflow_tests.png)]

When your Terraform code is stored in a version control system, you unlock extra features like pull requests, code reviews and testing. Here's an example showing some tests that run on our training lab repo.

---
name: everything-is-recorded
# No More Untracked Changes
.center[![:scale 100%](images/git_commit_log.png)]

Every infrastructure change is recorded and tracked in the git log. You will always know exactly who made a change, what was changed, who approved the change, and when and why the change was made.

# Sentinel
## Policy Enforcement for Terraform

---

# What is Sentinel?
```hcl
# Restricting region in AWS
aws_region_valid = rule {
  all region_values as rv {
	rv == "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

Sentinel is HashiCorp's policy enforcement language. Sentinel policies are checked after **`terraform plan`** is run. Sentinel will intercept bad configurations *before* they go to production, not after.

---
name: what-can-sentinel-do
# Example Uses for Sentinel
* Enforce owner allow list on aws_ami data source
* Enforce mandatory tags on instances
* Restrict availability zones
* Disallow 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR blocks
* Restrict instance types of EC2 instances
* Require VPCs to be tagged and have DNS hostnames enabled

You can implement these rules and many more using Sentinel.

---
name: sentinel-enforcement-levels
# Sentinel Enforcement Levels
‚è∞ **Advisory** - Issues a warning to the user when they trigger a plan that violates the policy.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Soft-Mandatory** - Blocks regular users from deploying the non-compliant infrastructure. Only admins can override.

üõë **Hard-Mandatory** - Blocks all users and apps from deploying the non-compliant infrastructure.

# What is a Terraform Module?
.center[![:scale 90%](images/aws_vpc_module.png)]

Modules are reusable units of Terraform code that hide unnecessary complexity from the user. This one creates a standard VPC configuration with only 8 variables.

---
name: how-modules-configured
# How are Terraform Modules Configured?
Creating Terraform Modules in 3 easy steps:

1. Write some Terraform code, configuring inputs and outputs.
2. Store the Terraform code somewhere your workstation can access it.
3. Reference your modules by file path or source URL.

Sounds easy right?

What if you had to manage dozens or hundreds of modules, with different versions of each?

---
name: private-module-registry
class: img-right
# Private Module Registry
![](images/aws_pmr.png)

Terraform modules are reusable packages of Terraform code that you can use to build your infrastructure.

Terraform Cloud includes a Private Module Registry where you can store, version, and distribute modules to your organizations and teams.

# Create a workspace using the API
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --header \
"Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" --request POST \
--data @/tmp/create_workspace.json \
https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/workspaces
```

1. Applications and tools authenticate to the API with a token.
2. JSON payloads determine which knobs and buttons to push.
3. The JSON payloads are submitted to different API endpoints depending on what you're doing.

Most programming languages have helper libraries for working with APIs.
